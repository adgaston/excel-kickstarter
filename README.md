Also submitted the following report to answer questions given

- What are some conclusions we can make about Kickstarter campaigns given the provided data? 

1. In the realm of film & video: documentaries, shorts and television have a 100% success rate, while animation, drama and science fiction have a 0% success rate. That could result from the independent nature of both documentaries and shorts and their need for funding for the project to be completed. Animation, drama and science fiction seem to be more mainstream and most likely have more backing from the film & video industry without the need for independent funding. Television from first glance looks to be mainstream but seems to follow the independent path of docs and shorts.

2. Music looks to be a lucrative option on Kickstarter as well. Popular genres of music like electronic, metal, pop and rock have 100% success rates, whereas genres like faith, jazz and world music do not see as much success or any at all. Classical music seems to be a genre that will stand the test of time and not be swayed by popular music. An interesting note: 20 of the indie rock campaigns failed. Considering indie rock is at its heart “independent” and relies on self-funding many times, this is slightly surprising. However, one could argue that indie music isn’t in the popular realm like pop and rock, so it may not garner the global support as those genres would.

3. Campaigns in the publishing world only seem to work for nonfiction and radio & podcasts. Both have 100% success rates, while the other forms of publishing have a 100% canceled or failed rate. This could result from the fact that nonfiction works could be a subject that some are already familiar with, so they are more likely to donate to the campaign, compared to a fiction book that one would have no previous knowledge of. Also, radio and podcasts have been exploding for the past 5 years and people are always searching for new subjects, hence people would be more likely to donate to this campaign.

4. There doesn’t seem to be a big correlation between the time of year and whether or not the campaign is successful. One would think campaigns launched during the holiday season of November-January would be most successful, as that’s a time of year when people tend to be very giving. However, the success rates vary year to year. It does seem as if the campaigns tend to be more successful as the years go on – which could be caused by better user experiences, better interface and familiarity with online donation programs like Kickstarter or GoFundMe.

5. If a campaign was “spotlighted” (which I’m assuming is better placement on home pages, etc.) it has pretty much a 100% chance of being successful. If it’s not, it’s more likely to fail or be canceled. 


- What are some of the limitations of this dataset?

Some limitations of the dataset would be that all of the campaigns Kickstarter has launched (300,00+) are not included in the dataset. We also do not know if these are all the categories of campaigns on Kickstarter – there could be other categories that might be more successful, such as healthcare expenses.


- What are some other possible tables/graphs that we could create?

We could create tables/graphs showing the correlation between the “spotlight” campaigns that were TRUE and were successful and the “spotlight” campaigns that were FALSE and were not successful. We could also do the same for the “staff pick” campaigns that were TRUE and were successful and the “staff pick” campaigns that were FALSE and were not successful.
 
We could create tables/graphs showing the correlation between the # of backers and whether a campaign was successful. We could also look at the correlation between the country of origin for the campaign and whether it was successful compared to other countries.
